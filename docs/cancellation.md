# Cancellation policy

_Last updated: September 18, 2021_

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly in all of our apps — no phone calls required, no questions asked.

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, [contact us](mailto:support@ezfire.io). We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.

## What happens when you cancel?

We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t automatically prorate any unused time you may have left but if you haven’t used your account in months or just started a new billing cycle, [contact us](support@ezfire.io) for a [fair refund](/refund/). We’ll treat you right.

## Ezfire-initiated cancellations

We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period.

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service/). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](/abuse/).
