# Ezfire subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Ezfire (the service). We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending [GDPR safeguards](../regulations/index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/). Cloud Services provider.
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). Error reporting software.
- [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/). Transactional email service.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Payment processing services.
