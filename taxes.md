# Taxes!

Taxes are an important part of functional society. Where our products are taxable, we collect and remit consumption tax to governments at the local, state, and/or federal levels. If your billing address is in one of the following jurisdictions, you’ll see an _additional_ line item on your invoice for sales tax. The subscription prices on our product websites are all exclusive of sales tax.

The tax rate and rules are determined by each jurisdiction and sometimes vary by whether you are using our products for business/commercial or personal purposes. As regulations change, we will update this list.

## Jurisdictions we collect and remit taxes for

### Within Canada

We collect sales tax from [Ezfire](https://ezfire.io/) customers in all provinces and territories in Canada.

## Updating your billing address

If you need to change your billing information because you don’t actually reside in a taxable jurisdiction, you can easily handle that within your accounts. You may need to re-enter your credit card information as part of the billing address update.

## We’re here to help

Please [contact our Support team](mailto:support@ezfire.io) if you have trouble or if:

- you believe you’re being charged in error.
- your organization is tax exempt.
